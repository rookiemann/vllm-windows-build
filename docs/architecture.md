# Architecture

How the v0.27.1 Windows release hangs together and what each piece
owns. The current patch is based on upstream v0.27.1; the native source and
wheel are produced in `E:\vllm-windows-build-v2`.

## Layer 1: Windows Compatibility Patch

`vllm-windows-v10.patch` is the exact committed unified diff against upstream
`vllm-project/vllm` tag `v0.27.1`. Older patch files are retained only for
their matching historical releases.

Main categories:

- Build system: MSVC/CUDA flags, CUDA 13.0 paths, CUTLASS patching, and
  skips for Linux-only optional extensions, plus Windows-safe generated
  FlashAttention Python-file copy-back.
- CUDA kernels: MSVC compatibility for GCC-only syntax and generated
  selector depth.
- Runtime Python: Windows multiprocessing, event-loop, networking,
  safetensors, and FakeProcessGroup fallbacks.
- Rust artifacts: packaging for `vllm-rs.exe` and `_rust_tool_parser.pyd`.
- Multi-TurboQuant: six local KV-cache compression methods carried
  alongside the four upstream TurboQuant variants.
- KV offload: Windows-safe DMA, shared mmap, filesystem I/O/cache paths,
  native `fs_io_C.pyd`, CPU LRU/ARC, and tiered persistent storage.

See [build.md](build.md) for the current build flow.

The 0.27.1 setup path packages the locally precompiled native and optimized
Rust artifacts without downloading an upstream Linux wheel.
`tests/test_wheel_contents.py` validates the required payloads and every ZIP
member against wheel RECORD before release.

## Layer 2: Portable Installer

`install.bat` provides the no-compiler path:

1. Downloads embedded Python 3.13.14 and verifies its exact size and SHA-256.
2. Adds CPython development files (`Include\Python.h` and
   `libs\python313.lib`) from the Python NuGet package for Triton's
   runtime CUDA helper compilation.
3. Installs PyTorch 2.13.0+cu130 and `triton-windows` 3.7.1.post27.
4. Verifies and installs the v0.27.1 wheel, the pinned Multi-TurboQuant
   wheel, and structured-output backends.
   Artifacts are downloaded through `.part` files and the install marker stores
   both release SHA-256 values only after the full runtime check succeeds.
5. Verifies both `import vllm` and Triton's CUDA driver path.

The vLLM module and installed distribution metadata both report `0.27.1`.
The runtime verifier separately enforces Torch 2.13.0+cu130 and Triton 3.7.1
so a wrong binary stack is rejected even when the package version matches.

Before Python exists, `verify_bootstrap.ps1` computes SHA-256 through .NET and
`expand_zip.ps1` extracts archives through `System.IO.Compression`. This avoids
PowerShell module cmdlets that are absent in some Windows environments; the ZIP
helper also rejects entries that escape the destination directory.

`launch.bat` checks the exact marker hash plus Python, native/Rust,
FlashAttention, model-module, dependency, and Triton development files before
starting the server.
If anything is incomplete, it reruns `install.bat`.

For wheel installs, both scripts prefer Triton's bundled CUDA helper
toolkit when it is present, avoiding accidental use of an incompatible
system `CUDA_PATH`.

## Layer 3: Serving Entry Points

There are two serving paths:

- `vllm_launcher.py`: a Windows-friendly OpenAI-compatible server that
  keeps the launch path explicit and supports chat completions,
  embeddings, health checks, streaming, and parsed tool calls.
- `vllm serve`: upstream vLLM's CLI server, with the Windows event-loop
  and process-handling fixes carried in the patch.

`launch.bat` starts `vllm_launcher.py` and pins the portable environment.
`engine_dispatcher.py` gives one task exclusive ownership of `engine.step()`
and routes each output to its request queue so concurrent streams cannot steal
or discard another request's output. The installer adds the repository root to
`python313._pth` so embedded Python can import this launcher module explicitly.

## Layer 4: Prompt-KV Offload

`OffloadingConnector` remains the vLLM integration point. The launcher maps
its opt-in modes onto two native vLLM specs:

- `CPUOffloadingSpec`: a pinned-RAM primary tier with LRU or ARC eviction.
- `TieringOffloadingSpec`: the same RAM primary tier plus a filesystem
  secondary tier with independent read- and write-priority worker pools.

The GPU worker transfers blocks through CUDA DMA. On Windows, file-backed mmap
restores use the native batch-copy route because Triton cannot safely
dereference that registered host pointer for every payload shape. The scheduler
and GPU worker share a Windows `mmap.ACCESS_WRITE` mapping in the system temp
directory. Filesystem blocks use binary mode and a sanitized, hashed namespace
derived from the complete model/cache configuration.

Offload is disabled by default. Filesystem mode requires an explicit root,
sets no disk quota, and needs a fixed `PYTHONHASHSEED` before process startup
for cache filenames to remain reusable across restarts. `launch.bat` sets the
seed; users still own cache-directory capacity and cleanup.

## Layer 5: KV Cache Compression

The current build exposes ten KV-cache compression dtypes:

- Six local Multi-TurboQuant methods:
  `isoquant3`, `isoquant4`, `planarquant3`, `planarquant4`,
  `turboquant25`, `turboquant35`.
- Four upstream TurboQuant variants:
  `turboquant_k8v4`, `turboquant_4bit_nc`,
  `turboquant_k3v4_nc`, `turboquant_3bit_nc`.

The local methods are wired through
`vllm/v1/attention/ops/multi_turboquant_kv.py` and
`vllm/v1/attention/backends/triton_attn.py`.

The persistent KV cache is stored as `torch.uint8`, roughly halving cache
memory. Active blocks are decoded into a compact fp16 temporary cache for
the attention call. The memory savings are real; the local methods still
pay a throughput cost because encode/decode currently run through a
PyTorch fallback path.

## Layer 6: Windows Safetensors Reader

The patch keeps the custom Windows safetensors path for systems with a
small or disabled pagefile:

1. Memory-map safetensors files with `numpy.memmap`.
2. Stream large tensors to GPU in chunks.
3. Avoid large committed CPU staging buffers that trigger Windows
   `OSError 1455`.

## Future Work

- Fuse local Multi-TurboQuant encode/decode into Triton kernels.
- Shrink local TQ cache slots to the exact packed dimension instead of
  preserving the standard slot width.
- Add calibrated outlier indices for `turboquant25`/`turboquant35`.
- Improve multi-GPU support beyond the current single-GPU Windows path.
- Add an explicit filesystem byte quota/eviction policy before considering the
  storage tier a general-purpose default.
- Evaluate remote/distributed tiers separately; this release does not port
  LMCache P2P, NIXL, GDS, object-store, or remote cache features.
