# Install vLLM v0.27.1 on Windows

> v0.27.1 is the current CUDA 13.0 release with native SM
> 7.5/8.6/8.9/12.0 kernels. The locally built wheel is in
> `E:\vllm-windows-build-v2\dist-v0.27.1`.

Two paths:

- **Install the pre-built wheel**: no compiler needed; recommended for most users.
- **Build from source**: requires Visual Studio 2022, CUDA 13.0, Python 3.13, and patience.

`install.bat` handles the wheel path end to end. The current source build is
driven by `build_cu130_py313_v0.27.1.bat` in `E:\vllm-windows-build-v2`.

## Install The Wheel

### Requirements

| Component | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | 10 / 11 x64 | Tested on Windows 10 Pro 22H2 |
| GPU | NVIDIA SM 7.5+ | RTX 20/30/40/50, A100, H100 |
| Driver | R580+ | Required by CUDA 13.0 |
| Python | 3.13.x | `install.bat` uses embedded Python 3.13.14 plus headers/libs for Triton |
| PyTorch | 2.13.0+cu130 | CUDA 13.0 runtime from PyTorch wheels |
| Triton | triton-windows 3.7.1.post27 | Installed by `install.bat` |
| Disk | 5 GB+ | Python, PyTorch, Triton, and wheel |

You do not need CUDA Toolkit or Visual Studio to install the pre-built wheel.

### Automated Install

```bat
install.bat
```

The installer downloads embedded Python, adds the Python headers/libs
needed by Triton's runtime compiler, installs PyTorch cu130,
triton-windows, the vLLM wheel, structured-output backends, and verifies
both `import vllm` and Triton's CUDA runtime driver path.

The pre-Python bootstrap requires Windows PowerShell 3 or newer but does not
require `Get-FileHash` or `Expand-Archive`. Hashing and ZIP extraction use .NET
helpers included beside `install.bat`, and downloads use basic parsing without
the Internet Explorer engine. `get-pip.py` is fetched from an immutable PyPA
commit so its pinned size and SHA-256 remain reproducible.

Fresh embedded-Python extraction is staged under `python.part` and renamed only
after the exact Python version runs successfully. A failed extraction removes
the staging directory, so rerunning the installer starts from a clean state.

It caches state in:

- `python\.torch-installed`
- `python\.vllm-installed` (contains the verified vLLM and Multi-TurboQuant SHA-256 values)

Delete those files to force reinstall.

Rerunning `install.bat` repairs an existing portable Python 3.13 directory if
its marker hash, dependencies, native/Rust files, generated FlashAttention
modules, `Include\Python.h`, or `libs\python313.lib` are missing. A stale or
truncated local wheel is deleted and downloaded again through a `.part` file.
`launch.bat` performs the same release-contract checks before starting the
server.
If `python\` is from an older major/minor Python version, delete
`python\` and rerun the installer.

### Manual Install

```bat
py -3.13 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

pip install torch==2.13.0 torchaudio==2.11.0 torchvision==0.28.0 ^
    --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130

pip install triton-windows==3.7.1.post27
pip install "llguidance>=1.7.0,<1.8.0" "xgrammar>=0.2.0,<1.0.0"
pip install multi_turboquant-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
pip install dist-v0.27.1\vllm-0.27.1-cp313-cp313-win_amd64.whl
```

Or download the wheel from the latest GitHub release:

```text
https://github.com/aivrar/vllm-windows-build/releases/tag/v0.27.1-win-cu130
```

### Verify

```bat
python -c "import importlib.metadata, vllm; print(vllm.__version__); print(importlib.metadata.version('vllm'))"
vllm --help
vllm serve --help
```

Expected runtime and distribution versions:

```text
0.27.1
0.27.1
```

The runtime and distribution metadata both report 0.27.1. `verify_install.py`
also checks the Torch CUDA and Triton versions.

## Build From Source

### Requirements

| Component | Version |
|---|---|
| Visual Studio | VS 2022 with C++ workload |
| CUDA Toolkit | 13.0 Update 2 |
| Python | 3.13.x |
| PyTorch | 2.13.0+cu130 |
| Ninja | Available in the venv or on PATH |
| Rust | Current stable MSVC toolchain |
| protoc | Required for the v0.27.1 Rust frontend/tool parser |
| RAM | 32 GB minimum, 64 GB recommended |
| Disk | 30 GB+ |

### Source Tree

```bat
cd /d E:\vllm-windows-build-v2
git -C vllm-source-v0.27.1 describe --tags --always
```

The v2 tree contains the native Windows changes and compiled artifacts used by
the release, so do not apply another patch on top of it. To start from a clean
upstream v0.27.1 checkout instead, apply the current
`vllm-windows-v10.patch` as documented in [build.md](build.md).

### Build

Run the v2 build script from a Visual Studio developer command prompt:

```bat
cd /d E:\vllm-windows-build-v2
build_cu130_py313_v0.27.1.bat
```

Important defaults:

```bat
set TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=7.5;8.6;8.9;12.0
set MAX_JOBS=8
set VLLM_DISABLE_SCCACHE=1
set SETUPTOOLS_SCM_PRETEND_VERSION=0.27.1
```

The checked-in v2 script uses the available worker budget (`MAX_JOBS=8` on the
tested machine). If memory or compiler stability is lower on another machine,
reduce it to 2 before rebuilding.

### Build A Wheel From An Already-Built Tree

After the editable install succeeds and `vllm.egg-info` exists:

```bat
cd /d E:\vllm-windows-build-v2\vllm-source-v0.27.1
set VLLM_USE_LOCAL_PRECOMPILED=1
set VLLM_SKIP_PRECOMPILED_VERSION_SUFFIX=1
set VLLM_VERSION_OVERRIDE=0.27.1
uv build --wheel --no-build-isolation --out-dir E:\vllm-windows-build-v2\dist-v0.27.1
```

Output:

```text
E:\vllm-windows-build-v2\dist-v0.27.1\vllm-0.27.1-cp313-cp313-win_amd64.whl
```

## Runtime Environment

Keep single-rank Windows initialization on the loopback interface:

```bat
set VLLM_HOST_IP=127.0.0.1
```

Do not set `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` for this Windows
build. PyTorch reports that expandable segments are unsupported on this
platform, so the setting only adds a warning and does not repair an OOM.

For multi-GPU systems, set the CUDA device ordering explicitly:

```bat
set CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER=PCI_BUS_ID
set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
```
